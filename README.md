# infrastructure-home-test

Hi, please follow these instructions to run the tests and make sure the exercise done fine:

Please before you run the tests comment all the pulumi.output commands in the main.py. I saw an issue on github which throw an error on this and I didnt figure out how to overcome it.

* Cd into hirundo-exercise\infrastructure-home-test
* Run pip install -r requirements.txt
* Cd into hirundo-exercise\infrastructure-home-test/infrastructure_home_test
* Run pytest (make sure the file test_main.py exists there).
